Simni
=====

In-browser side-scrolling 2D simulation for robotics.

Simni is a Simulator and implementation of the CSL sensorimotor loop and the ABC learning framework (cf. http://neurorobotics.de/index_en.php). It includes the Simni robot morphology and tries to accurately simulate its Robotis Dynamixel RX-28 servos.
It allows live interaction with the simulation and includes various visualizations.

The simulator can also be extended to simulate any other morphology using Box2D links and motors.

The simulation uses Box2D, arbor.js, three.js and various other 3rd party Javascript libraries.

Further documentation can be found in the file documentation.pdf.
