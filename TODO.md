TODO

* more morphologies: i.e. two ellipses with one rotational joints (needs ABC learning to be made completely joint agnostic)
* better release behavior
    * e.g. bias that is large enough to break symmetry, when stiction
      is overcome, a second lower bias value is set
    * alternatively velocity-ctrl plus detector for contact
* fourth and fifth sub-manifold is not reached, maybe try to get there
  (differences in csl and friction)
