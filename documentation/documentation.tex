\section{Introduction}

The Simni simulator is a testbed for simple robots that work in a two-dimensional world
(restricted). The built-in morphology is imitating the Semni morphology of the Neurorobotics
Research Laboratory, Berlin, (see \url{http://neurorobotics.de}).  On top of the physics simulation,
it contains an implementation of the ABC learning framework to explore the morphology's own stable
and instable fixpoints and hence find trajectories between energy efficient postures. 

It provides phase space and motor voltage plots and a graph representation of the interesting
postures and connection between them in the explored manifold.

\section{Requirements}

\begin{itemize}
\item A browser, preferrably with a fast JavaScript implementation like V8. Recommended at the time
    of writing is Google Chrome or Chromium version 30 or newer.
\item For compiling the CoffeeScript sources, a recent CoffeeScript compiler. Version 1.7.1 was used
    during development.

\end{itemize}

\section{Usage}

To open up the simulator locally, run
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
python serve.py
\end{lstlisting}
to start a simple local webserver and open \url{http://127.0.0.1:8000/simulator.html} in your
browser.
You should get a window with a Semni outline in the top left and some controls and boxes underneath
it. Using your mouse, you can interact with the simulated bodies.
Alternatively, the simulator will be available as long as possible under
\url{http://www2.informatik.hu-berlin.de/~bethge/simni/simulator.html}.

\subsection{Data plotters}

The data plotters are in the top right of the page.
To see current data and a history of the last 1000 time steps (96 Hz control loop), click the enable boxes in the top left of each graph. Phase trajectory displays in red, with the hip angle on the x-axis and the knee angle on the y-axis (it might be hard to find if there is no movement). The motor torque is displayed in green for the hip and blue for the knee torque.

\subsection{Buttons, Toggles and Shortcuts}

There are a number of controls in the interface that are grouped by usage.\ The ``Simulation
Controls'' allow the selection of morphologies, at the moment single and double pendulum and Semni.
``Simulate in Realtime'' is intended to make the physics move the robot at about 60 fps which
corresponds to about the same speed as realtime. Otherwise the simulation will run as fast as
possible. ``Pause/Run Simulation'' toggles between halting and running again. The graph layouting and
other processes independent from the physics will not be paused. While paused, progressing one step
can be achieved by pressing ``Next step(s)''. This means however 10 physics simulation steps and one
controller step, c.f. Section~\ref{sim_internal}. The buttons ``toggle CSL'' and ``toggle bounce
controller'' each enable or disable motor controllers for both joints. The CSL controller will use
the paramters below the buttons, the bounce controller (using constant velocity and changing
direction on stall) has default parameters.

The ``ABC learning'' group contains controls related to the learning framework. The button ``toggle
explore'' will also toggle the CSL controller and will start exploring. It will use the ``heurisitc''
setting to determine the next csl mode when a fixpoint was detected. This
change will be reflected in the select boxes and the CSL parameters on the left.  The buttons ``Save
graph as SVG'', ``Save graph as JSON'' and ``Load graph from JSON'' should be self explanatory.
``Load graph from Semni'' loads a list of nodes as they are printed over a serial console from the
associated ABC implementation on a hardware Semni robot.  All progress will be displayed in the
graph below all of the controls after postures are detected. The group ``Graph properties'' holds
settings for the visual graph representation. Repulsion and stiffness relate to the spring
simulation between nodes and changes the way the layouting looks and behaves. These will need a
browser with support for html range elements. ``Animate graph'' will toggle whether the graph is
continuously redrawn or only once when a new posture is detected or when the user moves or hovers
nodes in the graph with the mouse.  ``Pause graph layouting between new poses'' will make the layout
algorithm be stopped after a few seconds of processing whenever a posture was found. Otherwise it
will run continuously and might slow down the physics simulation. If the page was loaded from a
remote url, web workers will be used for the layouting which runs the layouting on a different CPU
core than the physics (if possible) and will make this setting unnecessary. ``Show node activation''
will show the numerical value that indicates how much there is to explore or to still be learned at
each node. This is used with the unseen mode strategy to determine which edge to follow when for one
node, all possible directions have been taken already. The same information is shown by colour if
``Show node activation colors'' is activated. ``Show Semni postures'' will trigger the display of
small semni images above each node in the graph. ``Show transition labels'' will show the CSL mode
that was set during a transition from one node to another, in addition to the mode on the node, as
these may differ. Finally, ``Save graph with every new posture'' will save the whole graph as JSON
file whenever a new pose is found to have an automatic history of what happened.  Further details of
the learning process can be found in the web browser's console.

The more frequent buttons have one letter shortcuts as depicted by the [ ] brackets in their button
label, so pressing this letter key will call that action.

Next to the simulation visualization, there are options to zoom the view, show current angles and
center of mass (COM) and drop in test objects. Dragging the white space of the simulation view with
the mouse pans the view. It is also possible to save and load the current position and angles of the
semni robot.

\section{Morphologies}
\subsection{Included}
\begin{itemize}
\item Single Pendulum
\item Double Pendulum
\item Semni
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Custom}

It is possible to add further morphologies by producing a file that holds JS arrays with the point
data of the new entity. The points have to be in counter clockwise order (CCW) and have to produce no
concave polygons (otherwise they can be separated into convex polygons with the b2Separator class).
The separate parts have to be added and connected with joints in-code as is done for the existing ones
in the file physics.coffee. Confer the Box2d documentation for the possible joints and settings.

\section{Simulator Interna}
\label{sim_internal}

The simulation uses a version of Box2D (2.1a3) that was ported to JavaScipt. I added a patch
so a torque can be applied directly to a joint.
The morphology is drawn on an html5 canvas, the graph is drawn directly with svg and the manifold
data is drawn with webgl.

Apart from the basic physics simulation, there is a simple motor model and a simple fluid friction
model for the joint servos.

    \caption{The components of the simulation CSL controller, motor model and
    friction model and Box2D. Empty circles denote a multiplication, circles with plus sign
    an addition. Plus or minus on an arrow give the sign for an addition.
    Values in square brackets give the symbol for an dimension. In this way, $u$ denotes
    a voltage, $M$ a Torque and $\dot{\phi}$ an angular velocity.}
    \label{fig:controllermodel}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Friction}

In addition to the movements of the objects themselves, frition forces occur between two bodies that
are in contact. These are directed against the forces that produce the motion and can be considered
threefold.  If the two bodies remain completely still, \textit{static friction} occurs, which is
dependent on the materials and the pressure and prevents movement up to a maximum force $F_H^{Max}$.
So it can be though ofa force $F_H$ equal to the moving force $F$ being applied in opposite
direction.  Let $\mu_H$ be the friction coefficient of static friction and $F_N$ be the force
perpendicular to the surface. Then for $v = 0$:
\begin{eqnarray}
    F_H & = & -F \\
    F_H \le \vec F_H^{Max} & = & \mu_H \cdot F_N
\end{eqnarray}

If the applied force is greater than $F_H^{Max}$, movement begins along the surfaces and the bodies
are no longer subject to static friction but to \textit{gliding friction}.
This in turn is divided into the \textit {dry friction}, a constant frictional force,
and \textit{viscous friction}, which depends on the velocity of the movement.
The dry friction force is also called \textit{Coulomb friction}.
and is only dependent on the normal force $F_N$ and a coefficient $\mu_G$ for the
specific material combination that is involved.
\begin{eqnarray}
    F_{G_T} = \mu_G \cdot F_N
\end{eqnarray}

The viscous friction force, however, is additionally dependent on velocity $v$ or the
angular velocity $\omega$ respectively and a separate coefficient $\mu_V$.

\begin{eqnarray}
    F_{G_V} = \mu_V \cdot F_N \cdot v
\end{eqnarray}

\section{ABC learning}
    The simulator implements a variant of the ABC learning framework that aims at finding
    semantically important points of the dynamical systems state space.
    For that goal, the manifold is explored using the CSL controller and that way probes the
    actual events for their properties.

    \subsection{CSL modes}
        Instead of just using the parameters directly, it makes sense to name certain paramter sets
        as modes which exhibit one of the behavioural modes the CSL can exhibit.
        The ABC learning henceforth only changes between the modes \textit{release}, \textit{contraction}
        and \textit{stall}.

    \subsection{Posture Graph}
        During the exploration, fixpoints and attractors are detected and saved as a node in the
        posture graph. Each box displays a small representation of the configuration of the robot
        and some values are listed in the box. These are the id number of the posture, possibly the
        node activation and the modes for the hip joint and knee joint in that order.

    \subsection{Heuristics}
        There are different ways of deciding which direction to take next (random, unvisited edges),
        and later on which edge to chose again if all possible directions have been probed. The
        ``unseen'' heuristic has some options to prefer changing or keeping the current joint and
        direction, comparing of which effects was one of the reasons the simulator was made.
